## Description of Paper
This research introduces an innovative system for predicting diabetes that leverages a variety of machine-learning techniques. It incorporates a novel dataset from Bangladeshi female patients, assessing various algorithms such as decision trees, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, and ensemble methods to determine the most effective features for diabetes prediction.

## Problem Statement
The research addresses the need for early and precise diabetes detection, a critical factor in preventing the severe complications associated with the disease. Despite diabetes being a leading cause of morbidity worldwide, existing diagnostic methods are often inadequate for early detection.

## Context of the Problem
Diabetes affects millions globally and can lead to serious health issues if not diagnosed early. The current diagnostic tools and methods fall short of predicting diabetes at an early stage, necessitating more effective solutions.

## Solution
The proposed solution is a diabetes prediction system tailored for a private dataset of female patients from Bangladesh, though it also utilizes the Pima Indian dataset for broader applicability. The study highlights the superior performance of the XGBoost classifier enhanced with the ADASYN technique, achieving an accuracy of 81%, an F1 score of 0.81, and an AUC of 0.84. To add transparency to the model predictions, explainable AI techniques using the LIME and SHAP frameworks are employed. The paper culminates in the deployment of this system into a web interface and an Android app, enabling real-time, user-friendly diabetes prediction.
